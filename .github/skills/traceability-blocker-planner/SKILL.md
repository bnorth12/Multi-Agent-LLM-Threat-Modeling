# Traceability Blocker Planner Skill

## Purpose
Provide an optional, repeatable planning-phase automation pass that turns traceability validation failures into an actionable remediation backlog.

## Inputs
- Sprint identifier (`YYYY_MM`)
- `scripts/verify_sprint_traceability.py` output

## Procedure
1. Execute sprint traceability validation.
2. Classify blocker lines into:
- missing requirement documentation IDs
- issues missing explicit test evidence
3. Emit a backlog report with ordered remediation steps.

## Outputs
- `local_reviews/latest/traceability_blocker_backlog_latest.md`
- `local_reviews/latest/traceability_blocker_backlog_latest.json`
